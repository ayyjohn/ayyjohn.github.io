I left Dropbox!
Today is my first day at [Jumpstart.me](https://jumpstart.me) and I couldn't be more excited.

## Why I Left Dropbox

*Note: This is not a post for airing my grievances. If you're a current or prospective Dropbox employee and would like to talk, feel free to reach out.*

That said, I feel confident saying that I would still be at Dropbox if the company hadn't decided to [switch to virtual first](https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/dropbox-goes-virtual-first).
Simply put, working remotely at Dropbox was not for me, and so once the announcement came out that the change was permanent, it was only a matter of time.

Why wasn't Virtual First at Dropbox for me?

In 2020 I, like a lot of other people, had a lot of time to read.
Early in work from home I was struggling to feel engaged with work. I didn't feel like I was learning anything new or making a positive impact on the Dropbox's codebase or product.
This lead me to spend a lot of time reading self-helpy books about how to do my job better. [The Passionate Programmer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6399113-the-passionate-programmer), [The Clean Coder](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10284614-the-clean-coder), [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer). They're all good books, don't get me wrong.
But over time it became clear that it wasn't that there was something that I didn't know, it was that I didn't _care_.

Other friends in tech expressed similar sentiments.
Disillusionment with the glamor of working at FAANG tier companies once their offices were the same as any other job. Frustration with the ratio of process to programming. Hopelessness in the face of unmaintainable codebases.

I began to read more about individualism and empowerment. Two pieces that resonated particularly painfully with me were [Bullshit Jobs by David Graeber](https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/) and [Smart People Should Build Things by Andrew Yang](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18085527-smart-people-should-build-things).

It became difficult to ignore that I didn't feel like there would be a difference whether or not I did my job, and without the benefits of a glamorous office to look forward to, there wasn't much left for me. I missed my teammates and felt isolated from them.
<!-- something about the allure of the startup lifestyle -->

And so I started searching for something different.

## A Mission Driven Company

For the last two years I've been volunteering at [Ada Academy, a bootcamp for women and nonbinary people](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/), and it's hard to express in words how much I love working there.
I started with 1:1 tutoring, but each quarter my involvement has only grown. Now I TA for their admissions prep course, I give mock interviews, and I do presentations for each cohort on things from solving algorithms questions to the basics of machine learning classifiers.

The goal with my next company was to get the same feeling from my daily work that I do from volunteering at Ada. I want to work somewhere where I don't even notice how long I've been working, rather than counting the hours.

<!-- fix the ordering of the next few sentences -->
Getting people hired is a personal passion of mine. I've been helping friends with interview prep ever since graduating from [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/), and I'm thrilled to be doing that at scale.

Specifically, helping people find their first jobs in tech is one of my favorite things, and that was literally what Jumpstart was originally founded to do.

Transitioning to a career as a software engineer has never been more accessible and it's one of the best ways to improve the world while building generational wealth.
A friend of mine recently finished what was, by App Academy's standards, a miserable job search after graduating in March of 2020, and he still landed a base salary of $110k plus equity at a small startup. He'll never struggle to find work again.

Now Jumpstart works to improve diversity hiring. Diversity hiring is one of those incredible virtuous cycles where the more people are hired, the stronger the network effects for those who come after them who can then find connections and mentors. Rinse and repeat.

## "But Wait, Won't You Still Be Working Remotely?"

You're right! For the foreseeable future I'll be working remotely at Jumpstart. Their HQ is in SF and I'm staying in Seattle.

Around September, 2020, when I started my job search, there wasn't a clear timeline yet for vaccines to roll out, and so beyond asking what the company's plan was post-lockdown, I wasn't really indexing highly on in person vs remote work.

See, independent of company mission, there are some massive difference between working remotely at a 2000+ employee company and a 70 employee company.

## Impact

For starters, I'm excited to have an impact. My team at Dropbox, which handled subscription management, is as big as the entire engineering team at Jumpstart.
This means bureaucracy and red tape will be way down and ownership will be far broader.

If you want to change something, you change it.

One of the coolest parts of being a software engineer is that your code can improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, millions if you're lucky.
<!-- On the flip side, there's something inherently depressing about failing to fulfill that potential. -->

It means a lot to me that I'll be able to quantify the positive impact I'll be making with each person the Jumpstart platform gets hired, and each company that improves its hiring pipeline for URM candidates.

## Culture

I know not everyone is like me in this respect, but I want to be friends with my teammates. Yes, "a job is a job," but if you're going to be spending eight hours a day with people, why not like those people? Why not want to hang out with some of those people outside of work?

I also really like the idea of being able to know all my coworkers.
With only ~70 employees there's more room for each person's personality to shine through, and more penetration of infectious energy.
It's one of the reasons why I'm so excited to work with people like [Tariq Meyers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tariq-meyers/). I could listen to him talk all day.

## Growth
During my two years at Dropbox, most of the learning I did was self directed. Their generous learning stipend allowed me to buy pretty much my entire to-read list as far as professional development.
This was awesome, but one of the reasons I went to Dropbox in the first place was to work on a system used by millions of people.

The problem is that Dropbox was built by such good engineers that pretty much everything as far as scalability was so far abstracted away from my day to day that I might as well have been working on a personal side project as far as scalability was concerned.

This is obviously a major win for Dropbox's platform team, but a loss for young engineers like me looking to grow early in their careers.
I can't wait to move fast, break things, outgrow our infrastructure, and learn a million things along the way.

## You're Not Alone

If I have some parting advice, it's this: if this post resonates with you, don't wait to make the move.

Companies where you can rest and vest will always be there, but right now is a great time to take a chance.
Other than monetary compensation there's not a lot big companies can offer right now over a smaller, more engaging company. And on that note, I didn't have to take a pay cut to go to Jumpstart.
