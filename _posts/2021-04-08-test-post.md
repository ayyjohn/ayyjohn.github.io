This is an interesting post in that it's not actually a post. Its entire purpose is to verify the behavior of custom lint rules that I write. 
If you're interested, read on, just know that the content of this post will change regularly as I write new lint rules so that I can verify their behavior. 

You could argue that I should write automated tests, and I might in the future, but for now I'm just getting used to markdownlint's custom rules.

{% endhighlight %}
