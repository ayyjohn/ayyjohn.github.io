Hi! Welcome to my blog.

My name is Alec, but my IRC friends call me ayyjohn. I've always wanted to see if I could make AJ happen.

I'm a software engineer at [jumpstart](https://jumpstart.me).

I'm not really sure what this blog is "about" yet, I'm still developing my personal brand. My interests are kind of all over the place, but you can expect to see articles about

* things in Python I find nifty
* explanations of side projects
* reflections careers in software
* reviews of experiences
* armchair advice
* meta posts about blogging with Jekyll
* ...and more!

If you enjoy a post, [feel free to drop me a line](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayyjohn/)
